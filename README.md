# Sorting Manager Project
This project allows the user to sort a random array using different
types of algorithms and showing how long each sort takes.

For this project the main design patterns I used for the structure were the
**Model-View-Controller** and the **Factory Design Pattern**.

I also implemented **exception handling** and **JUnit tests** in this
project in order to test various parts of my project and
log specific errors where required.

For future variations of this project, I would like to implement more
tests and exception handling. I would also like to add a **Graphical
User Interface** in order to make it more user-friendly.
